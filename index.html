                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        Two areas of graphic design are emphasized: typography with a focus on writing and
                        editorial design, and information design with a focus on information graphics,
                        information architecture, and user-centered design methods. The students end up with a
                        comprehensive and elaborate folder of practical design projects, which after three years
                        of study are the starting point for the students' graduation exhibition.

                        <h3>Coding</h3>
                        When you have completed a Bachelor in Web Development, you should will be an expert on
                        things: Develop advanced and robust web solutions and work creatively and systematically
                        to develop innovative concepts for the web. You should want to take loose formulas from
                        a customer and develop this into a clearly defined concept that meets both customer's
                        and users' needs, and implement implementations and finished and prosperous web
                        solutions.

                        The faculty of design offers social meetingplaces and workshops like makerspace and codinglab.
                        The classrooms are open and available at any given time unless the classroom is taken. The line
                        association hosts events throughout the year e.g. Christmas party and seminars where companies

                    <h2>Who we are</h2>
                    <p>The Department of Design (ID) was established on January 1st, 2017 as the result of the merger
                        between NTNU and three university colleges. The department today consists of two groups which
                        are
                        about the same size: one at Gløshaugen campus in Trondheim and one in Gjøvik. The group in
                        Trondheim
                        is responsible for a 5-year integrated master degree in Industrial Design, a 2-year
                        International
                        Master in Industrial Design, as well as a doctoral program (PhD) in Industrial Design. The group
                        in
                        Gjøvik has responsibility for three Bachelor programs in graphic design, web development and
                        interaction design, and a 2-year master's degree in interaction design, as well as a one year
                        program in web design.</p>
